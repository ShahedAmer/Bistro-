# Bistro-
Bistro consists of two parts; a mobile application for customers and a website for restaurant owners.  instead of place restaurant orders through the phone. and searching for the menu options the restaurant offers through scattered social media posts. Our project allows customers to search between different restaurants, check their menus, and order from them using one centralized app.
